[00:00.98]Never thought I could become this strong in my whole life
[00:04.72]Crowd going back and forth
[00:06.78]They would take you somewhere
[00:08.31]So you have to stand strong
[00:10.19]And never let 'em take you to places you don't want
[00:16.10]I won't let somebody else
[00:17.93]Tell me that I am wrong
[00:19.83]And I'm not listening when they say that I'm messed up
[00:23.66]I'm okay even when I'm lost
[00:25.35]Becasue I have faith
[00:27.46]Don't need somebody to take my hand and lead me through
[]

[00:34.98]Never let it go when you have your dreams in your hands
[00:38.80]Get back what you lost a long ago

[00:45.30]So now I stand alone
[00:47.24]Standing tall
[00:48.63]No matter how strong
[00:50.20]the wind and rain is in my way and never going away
[00:53.62]Alive and I'm free as I can be

[]
[01:16.97]So you know that she wanted to keep you in her cage
[01:20.36]And you know they always wanted you on their side
[01:24.12]He just had to have everything in his hands
[01:28.00]All inside the swirling mind
[]
[01:31.82]Get back what you lost a long ago
[01:35.54]Something that made your life amazing and beautiful
[01:39.34]Get back what you lost a long ago
[01:43.10]'Cause it's still there in your heart
